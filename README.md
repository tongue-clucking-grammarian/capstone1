## Selling Annual Bike Subscriptions :bar_chart:
### 10/7/2022
This is the capstone project I completed to earn my Google Data Analytics certificate. 
Data is on 5878 company bicycles across over 600+ stations. Details such as trip start, trip end, type of bike, and 
whether rider is a member (pays annually) or casual (pay one bike trip at a time) user. The business task is to help
develop a marketing strategy to convert one-time riders into subscribers.
